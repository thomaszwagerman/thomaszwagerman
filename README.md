## Hi there :wave:,

My name is Thomas Zwagerman. I'm a **Data Intelligence Officer** at the [Suffolk County Council](https://www.suffolk.gov.uk/). I maintain the [SCC Planning](https://github.com/SCC-Planning) organisation on Github.

I previously worked as an **Environmental Data Scientist** and as a **Spatial Data Analyst** at the [UK Centre for Ecology and Hydrology](https://www.ceh.ac.uk/), where I developed tools and processes for the automated processing and quality assurance of air quality and climate change datasets, as well as developed interactive dissemination tools and reports for customers and stakeholders.

I graduated with a BSc in Ecology & Environmental Sciences from the University of Edinburgh in 2018. I wrote my dissertation on vegetation change impact on Arctic land-atmosphere interactions and snowmelt. Using the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model I examined data across spatial and temporal scales.

## :building_construction: Programming languages and tools:
I use R for almost everything, with sometimes a bit of Python. Other tools I use as required are the Jinja2 templating language and JavaScript/CSS/HTML for web development-related work.

I have the following experience:

* Shiny Development, using the [golem framework](https://thinkr-open.github.io/golem/) to develop applications as a package, writing [modules](https://mastering-shiny.org/scaling-modules.html) for scalable applications and writing unit tests with [testthat](https://testthat.r-lib.org/) and [shinytest2](https://rstudio.github.io/shinytest2/).
  
* Writing [plumber](https://www.rplumber.io/) APIs and leveraging web APIs with [httr](https://httr.r-lib.org/).

* Automating workflows using [RStudio Connect](https://www.rstudio.com/products/connect/) and [pins](https://github.com/rstudio/pins-r) or Github Actions.

* Writing scientific and technical report and publishing websites in [rmarkdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/), [distill](https://rstudio.github.io/distill/) and [quarto](https://quarto.org/), including creating company brand templates with HTML & CSS (see my [scctemplate](https://github.com/SCC-Planning/scctemplate) package).

* Spatial Data manipulation and visualisation with [sf](https://r-spatial.github.io/sf/), [terra](https://github.com/rspatial/terra), [leaflet](https://rstudio.github.io/leaflet/) and other relevant packages.

## :earth_africa: Socials & Website:
I am on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/thomzwa) and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/thomaszwagerman/). I also have my own [blog](https://tzwagerman.netlify.app/) with ocassional side projects. The blog is made with [distill](https://rstudio.github.io/distill/) and you can find the [repository](https://github.com/thomaszwagerman/tz_web_distill) on my page.

## :books: Resources I use:
My first stepts in R were at the [Coding Club](https://ourcodingclub.github.io/). 

Currently my favourite R books are [Mastering Shiny by Hadley Wickham](https://mastering-shiny.org/) and [Efficient R programming by Colin Gillespie and Robin Lovelace](https://csgillespie.github.io/efficientR/). 

When I worked as a Spatial Data Analyst, I learned most of my spatial R from [Geocomputation with R by Robin Lovelace](https://geocompr.robinlovelace.net/). 

I've taught as an instructor on [Transforming Environmental Data in R](https://www.ceh.ac.uk/training/transforming-environmental-data-r) - I learned a lot from teaching!
