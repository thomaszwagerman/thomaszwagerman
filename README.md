## Hi there :wave:,

My name is Thomas Zwagerman. I'm an environmental scientist and R developer, and currently on a little break from data science and software development!

I previously worked as an **Environmental Data Scientist** and as a **Spatial Data Analyst** at the [UK Centre for Ecology and Hydrology](https://www.ceh.ac.uk/), where I developed tools and processes for the automated processing and quality assurance of air quality and climate change datasets, as well as developed interactive dissemination tools and reports for customers and stakeholders. I have also worked as a **Data Intelligence Officer** at the [Suffolk County Council](https://www.suffolk.gov.uk/), where I maintained the [SCC Planning](https://github.com/SCC-Planning) organisation on Github.

Away from work I'm (slowly) working on my Shiny application [fplboard](https://tzwagerman.shinyapps.io/fplboard/).

## :building_construction: Programming languages and tools:
I use R for almost everything, with sometimes a bit of Python and more and more of JS/CSS/HTML.

I have the following experience:

* Shiny Development, using the [golem framework](https://thinkr-open.github.io/golem/) to develop applications as a package, writing [modules](https://mastering-shiny.org/scaling-modules.html) for scalable applications and writing unit tests with [testthat](https://testthat.r-lib.org/) and [shinytest2](https://rstudio.github.io/shinytest2/).
  
* Writing [plumber](https://www.rplumber.io/) APIs and leveraging web APIs with [httr](https://httr.r-lib.org/).

* Automating workflows using [RStudio Connect](https://www.rstudio.com/products/connect/) and [pins](https://github.com/rstudio/pins-r) or Github Actions.

* Writing scientific and technical report and publishing websites in [rmarkdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/), [distill](https://rstudio.github.io/distill/) and [quarto](https://quarto.org/), including creating company brand templates with HTML & CSS (see my [scctemplate](https://github.com/SCC-Planning/scctemplate) package).

* Spatial Data manipulation and visualisation with [sf](https://r-spatial.github.io/sf/), [terra](https://github.com/rspatial/terra), [leaflet](https://rstudio.github.io/leaflet/) and other relevant packages.

## :earth_africa: Socials & Website:
I am on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/thomzwa) and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/thomaszwagerman/). I also have my own [blog](https://tzwagerman.netlify.app/) with ocassional side projects. The blog is made with [distill](https://rstudio.github.io/distill/) and you can find the [repository](https://github.com/thomaszwagerman/tz_web_distill) on my page.

## :books: Resources I use:
My first stepts in R were at the [Coding Club](https://ourcodingclub.github.io/). 

A list of reference books I use frequently in no particular order: 
* [Mastering Shiny](https://mastering-shiny.org/) by Hadley Wickham.
* [Efficient R programming](https://csgillespie.github.io/efficientR/) by Colin Gillespie and Robin Lovelace.
* [R Packages](https://r-pkgs.org/) by Hadley Wickham and Jenny Bryan
* [Engineering Production-Grade Shiny Apps](https://engineering-shiny.org/index.html) by Colin Fay, SÃ©bastien Rochette, Vincent Guyader and Cervan Girard.
* [Geocomputation with R](https://geocompr.robinlovelace.net/) by Robin Lovelace, Jakub Nowosad, Jannes Muenchow.
* [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/) by Hadley Wickham and Garrett Grolemund.
