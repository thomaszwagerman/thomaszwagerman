## Hi there :wave:,

My name is Thomas Zwagerman. I'm a **Data Intelligence Officer** at the [Suffolk County Council](https://www.suffolk.gov.uk/). I maintain the [SCC Planning](https://github.com/SCC-Planning) organisation on Github.

I previously worked as an **Environmental Data Scientist** and as a **Spatial Data Analyst** at the [UK Centre for Ecology and Hydrology](https://www.ceh.ac.uk/), where I developed tools and processes for the automated processing and quality assurance of air quality and climate change datasets, as well as developed interactive dissemination tools and reports for customers and stakeholders.

## :building_construction: Programming languages and tools:
I use R for almost everything, with sometimes a bit of Python. Other tools I use as required are the Jinja2 templating language and JavaScript/CSS/HTML for web development-related work.

I have the follow experience:

* Shiny Development, using the [golem framework](https://thinkr-open.github.io/golem/) to develop applications as a package, writing [modules](https://mastering-shiny.org/scaling-modules.html) for scalable applications and writing unit tests with [testthat](https://testthat.r-lib.org/) and [shinytest2](https://rstudio.github.io/shinytest2/).
  
* Writing [plumber](https://www.rplumber.io/) APIs and leveraging web APIs with [httr](https://httr.r-lib.org/).

* Automating workflows using [RStudio Connect](https://www.rstudio.com/products/connect/) and [pins](https://github.com/rstudio/pins-r) or Github Actions.

* Writing scientific and technical report and publishing websites in [rmarkdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/), [distill](https://rstudio.github.io/distill/) and [quarto](https://quarto.org/), including creating company brand templates with HTML & CSS (see my [scctemplate](https://github.com/SCC-Planning/scctemplate) package).

* Spatial Data manipulation and visualisation with [sf](https://r-spatial.github.io/sf/), [terra](https://github.com/rspatial/terra), [leaflet](https://rstudio.github.io/leaflet/) and other relevant packages.

## :earth_africa: Socials & Website:
