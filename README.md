###Hi there ????,

My name is Thomas Zwagerman. I'm a **Spatial Data Analyst** at the [UK Centre for Ecology and Hydrology](https://www.ceh.ac.uk/).

I mainly work on spatial modelling of emissions and air pollutants. I'm responsible for the data management, manipulation and visualisation of spatial data. On a day-to-day basis I use R, Python, SQL and QGIS, as well as occasionally FME, Spark, JavaScript, CSS & HTML.

Sadly I cannot show all of my repositories, because I often work with sensitive/disclosive data.

###How to reach me 
I am on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/thomzwa) and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/thomaszwagerman/). I also have my own [blog](https://tzwagerman.netlify.app/) with ocassional side projects outwith the realm of environmental science.
