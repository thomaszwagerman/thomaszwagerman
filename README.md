### Hi there,

My name is Thomas Zwagerman. I'm a **Spatial Data Analyst** at the [UK Centre for Ecology and Hydrology](https://www.ceh.ac.uk/).

I mainly work on spatial modelling of emissions and air pollutants. I'm responsible for the data management, manipulation and visualisation of spatial data. On a day-to-day basis I use R, Python, SQL and QGIS, as well as occasionally FME, Spark, JavaScript, CSS & HTML.

Sadly I cannot show all of my repositories, because I often work with sensitive/disclosive data.
