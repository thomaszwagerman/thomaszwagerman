## Hi there :wave:,

My name is Thomas Zwagerman. I'm an **Environmental Data Scientist** at the [UK Centre for Ecology and Hydrology](https://www.ceh.ac.uk/).

## :deciduous_tree: Current work.
I develop tools and processes for the automated processing and quality assurance of air quality and climate change datasets, as well as develop interactive dissemination tools and reports for customers and stakeholders. 

My previous role at UKCEH was as a Spatial Data Analyst, where I developed skills in using spatial data formats and software.

## :building_construction: Programming languages and GIS tools:
I use R for almost everything, and sometimes use Python. Other tools I use as required are Jinja, JavaScript, CSS & HTML.

## :earth_africa: Socials & Website:
I am on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/thomzwa) and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/thomaszwagerman/). I also have my own [blog](https://tzwagerman.netlify.app/) with ocassional side projects outwith the realm of environmental science. The blog is made with [distill](https://rstudio.github.io/distill/) and you can find the [repository](https://github.com/thomaszwagerman/tz_web_distill) on my page.
