## Hi there :wave:,

My name is Thomas Zwagerman. I'm a **Research Software Engineer** at the [British Antarctic Survey](https://www.bas.ac.uk/).

I currently work on the [Autonomous Marine Operations Planning](https://www.bas.ac.uk/project/autonomous-marine-operations-planning/) project, and on enhancing model ensembling of [WAVI](https://github.com/RJArthern/WAVI.jl?tab=readme-ov-file), an ice sheet model. I mostly use Python, but R is my "first" language.

I previously worked as an **Environmental Data Scientist** and as a **Spatial Data Analyst** at the [UK Centre for Ecology and Hydrology](https://www.ceh.ac.uk/). I have also worked as a **Data Intelligence Officer** at the [Suffolk County Council](https://www.suffolk.gov.uk/), where I maintained the [SCC Planning](https://github.com/SCC-Planning) organisation on Github.
