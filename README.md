## Hi there :wave:,

I'm a **Spatial Data Analyst** at the [UK Centre for Ecology and Hydrology](https://www.ceh.ac.uk/).

## :deciduous_tree: What am I working on?
I mainly work on spatial modelling of emissions and air pollutants. I'm responsible for the data management, manipulation and visualisation of spatial data. In other words I make a lot of maps with code :globe_with_meridians:.

## :building_construction: What tools do I use?
On a day-to-day basis I use R, Python, SQL and QGIS, as well as occasionally FME, Spark, JavaScript, CSS & HTML.
