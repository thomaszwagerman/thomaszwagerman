### Hi there :wave:,

I'm a **Spatial Data Analyst** at the [UK Centre for Ecology and Hydrology](https://www.ceh.ac.uk/) :deciduous_tree: .

## :sunflower: What am I working on?
I mainly work on spatial modelling of emissions and air pollutants. I'm responsible for the data management, manipulation and visualisation of spatial data. 

## What tools do I use?
On a day-to-day basis I use R, Python, SQL and QGIS, as well as occasionally FME, Spark, JavaScript, CSS & HTML.

Sadly I keep a lot of my repositories on private, because I often work with sensitive/disclosive data.
